          Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki met in the 1960s when working for the Japanese animation studio
          Tôei Dôga. The two men worked together for more than a decade notably on the animation Heidi.
          But it wasn't until the early 1980s, when the growth of animation on television threatened the
          quality of productions, that these two enthusiasts decided to join forces to offer the public a
          quality animated feature film that would not overlook either the narration or the direction. In
          1985, a first collaboration ensues, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, the animated adaptation
          of the manga published by Miyazaki in the magazine Animage. On the strength of this first
          success, and convinced that there is a place for quality animated feature films on the Japanese
          market, they set up a small production studio in the suburbs of Tokyo, with the help of the
          Tokuma Shoten publishing company. In 1986 The Castle in the Sky was released on the screens, the
          first film officially created by Studio Ghibli, now at the head of more than 40 film and video
          game production.</p>
